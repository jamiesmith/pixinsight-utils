## FixTiledZoom

I like to tile my calibrated and integrated master frames, then stretch and zoom them to fit the window.


## SmartRenameView.js

This script simply renames the main view of an image to match whatever is in 
the filter, which allows you to hardcode values in your process icons (For example,
Red, Green, and Blue) rather than having to manually change them.
